# Tracking dung beetles in dim light environments
Many navigating animals (here with a focus on insects) rely on the sun, the polarization pattern formed around it and the celestial gradient of colour and intensity, to find their home or a breeding place. The discovery of the peculiar orientation system of dung beetles, designed to guide the beetle and its ball along a path as straight as the terrain allows (Fig. \ref{dungbeetle}), made it possible to take the study of celestial orientation even into the darkest hours of the night. To find their way across the savanna, these insects -- active at any time of day -- also rely on the moon, the dim polarization pattern associated with it, and the Milky Way. The combined power of these celestial compass cues -- a greater variety than has been demonstrated for any other insect -- allows dung beetles to navigate with the same precision irrespective of time of day and environmental conditions for as long as there is a source of light to orient by. To test the navigational performance of the dung beetle we need to be able to track the animal under extreme light conditions (e.g. complete darkness, weak UV, or directional polarized light). To date, all tracking was done by recording the navigating beetle with a video-camera and later tracking its trajectory from the video files. While this process has proven highly effective, it quickly becomes impossible in dim light conditions -- the very environments we want to test the beetles in. We therefore need to utilize some modality other than light in order to collect and sense the trajectory of the animal: Wi-Fi.

In insects, sky compass signals are sent via several intermediate stages to a brain area, termed the central complex, which acts as an internal compass for orientation. This area of the brain appears highly conserved across a wide range of species and plays a role also in walking, spatial orientation, memory for visual landmarks and visual place learning. How this multimodal role is managed at the cellular level is not known, but a quickly growing pool of studies indicates that its neuronal network is modulated in a context-dependent manner. This means, for example, that a neuron responds differently depending on whether the animal is flying or quiescent, walking or climbing or active at day or night. It can be concluded that i) the central complex contains highly dynamic circuitry and ii) to truly understand how a celestial compass works, we need to record from these neurons while the unconstrained animal is actively orienting in its natural environment. To record from a freely behaving animal we need to mount the beetles with a little backpack of electronics. Since the dung beetle is a robust insect capable of carrying heavy loads, and since we are already planning to mount the beetles with electrophysiological hardware to study their central complex, fitting them with a Wi-Fi device for tracking purposes should prove straight forward.
